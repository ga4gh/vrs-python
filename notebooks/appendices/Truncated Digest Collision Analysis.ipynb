    "* The computational time for SHA-512 is similar to that of other digest methods. Given that it is believed to distribute input bits more uniformly with no increased computational cost, it should be preferred for our use (and likely most uses).\n",

    "This is result was not expected initially. On further research, there is a clear explanation: The SHA-2 series of digests (which includes SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512) is defined using 64-bit operations. When an implementation is optimized for 64-bit systems (as used for these timings), the number of cycles is essentially halved when compared to 32-bit systems and digests that use 32-bit operations. SHA-2 digests are indeed much slower than SHA-1 and MD5 on 32-bit systems, but such legacy platforms is not relevant to the Truncated Digest."
