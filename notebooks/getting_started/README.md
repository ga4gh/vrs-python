# VRS Python Getting Started Notebook Series

This series of notebooks is intended to be the fastest way to becoming productive with
the [vrs-python](https://github.com/ga4gh/vrs-python) package. The intent of each
notebook in this series is to be an interactive introduction to functionally contained
in the vrs-python package.

A beginning developer level of familiarity with python, jupyter notebooks is assumed in
order to run this notebook series. You should be familiar with installing packages and
running commands in your execution environment.

## Development Environment Setup

We provide you two options for setting up your development environment: using a Python
[virtual environment](#virtual-environment) or leveraging
[VS Code Dev Containers](#dev-containers) (useful for non-macOS users).

### Fork the Repo

Fork the repo at <https://github.com/ga4gh/vrs-python/> and initialize a development
environment.

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_ID/vrs-python.git
cd vrs-python
```

### Virtual Environment

You must first install python@3.12, if not already installed.

Next, run the following:

```shell
make nbready
source venv/3.12/bin/activate
```

#### Virtual Environment: Selecting the Kernel

When opening a notebook with this option, click `Select Kernel`,
`Python Environments...`, and select the first option:
`3.12 (Python 3.12.z) venv/3.12/bin/python`

_Note: Patch version may vary._

### Dev Containers

#### Prerequisites

For your convenience, this section is copied from the
[VS Code Dev Containers Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial#_prerequisites).

* [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

  You must be using VS Code to use the Dev Containers.

* [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

  Docker is needed to create and manage your containers.

  * Docker Desktop

    Download and install
    [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), or an
    [alternative Docker option](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/docker-options),
    like Docker on a remote host or Docker compliant CLI.

  * Start Docker

    Run the Docker Desktop application to start Docker. You will know it's running if
    you look in the activity tray and see the Docker whale icon.

    Docker might take a few minutes to start. If the whale icon is animated, it is
    probably still in the process of starting. You can click on the icon to see the
    status.

  * Check Docker

    Once Docker is running, you can confirm that everything is working by opening a new
    terminal window and typing the command:

    ```shell
    docker --version
    ```

* [Install Dev Containers extension](vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

  The Dev Containers extension lets you run Visual Studio Code inside a Docker container.

#### Creating the Dev Container

Open the VS Code Command Palette: Shift + Command + P (Mac) / Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows/Linux)

Type and select the following inside the Command Palette: `> Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`

The Dev Container will be created and install the dependencies needed.

You should see `Dev Container: VRS-Python Notebooks @ desktop-linux` on the bottom left hand corner of VS Code.

#### Dev Containers: Selecting the Kernel

When opening a notebook with this option, click `Select Kernel`,
`Python Environments...`, and select the first option:
`Python 3.12.z /usr/local/bin/python`

_Note: Patch version may vary._

## Notebooks

### 1 Quick Start

The [Quick Start](1_Quick_Start.ipynb) notebook details how to get started by
setting up access to a SeqRepo *DataProxy* and introduces the user to using an *AlleleTranslator* to convert
the same allele to VRS form from both it's SPDI and HGVS nomenclature forms.

### 2 Exploring the SeqRepo Data Proxy

Sequence references are at the core of many of the operations for converting to and from VRS variant representations.
The [Exploring the SeqRepo Data Proxy](2_Exploring_the_SeqRepo_DataProxy.ipynb) notebook
has a number of useful utility methods for accessing information about sequence references.

### 3 Basic Models

In the [Basic Models](3_Basic_Models.ipynb) notebook, we explore building a VRS *Allele*
from its component parts. The notebook details how to add VRS identifiers to the identifiable components of the *Allele*.

### 4 Exploring the Allele Translator

The current implementation of vrs-python facilitates transformation of variants
in a number of different variant nomenclatures (SPDI, HGVS, gnomAD and Beacon) to VRS form. In the
[Exploring the Allele Translator](4_Exploring_the_AlleleTranslator.ipynb) notebook,
we show how to transform basic variants to VRS, and in some cases, back to the original nomenclature of the variant.

### 5 Exploring the CNV Translator

The final notebook of this series,
[Exploring the CNV Translator](5_Exploring_the_CnvTranslator.ipynb) details transformations
of various forms of copy number variation to their VRS representations.
