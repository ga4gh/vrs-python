# vrs-python

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ga4gh.vrs.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/ga4gh.vrs)
[![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/ga4gh/vrs-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ga4gh/vrs-python)


vrs-python provides Python language support for the [GA4GH Variation
Representation Specification
(VRS)](https://github.com/ga4gh/vrs).

This repository contains several related components:

* **ga4gh.core package** Python language support for certain nascent
  standards in GA4GH.  Eventually, this package should be moved to a
  distinct repo.

* **ga4gh.vrs package** Python language support for VRS. 

* **ga4gh.vrs.extras package** Python language support for additional
  functionality, including translating from and to other variant
  formats and a REST service to similar functionality.
  `ga4gh.vrs.extras` requires access to supporting data, as described
  below.

* **Jupyter notebooks** Demonstrations of the functionality of
  `ga4gh.vrs` and `ga4gh.vrs.extras` in the form of easy-to-read
  notebooks.


# VRS-Python and VRS Version Correspondence

The ga4gh/vrs-python repo embeds the ga4gh/vrs repo as a git
submodule, and therefore each ga4gh.vrs package on PyPi embeds a
particular version of VRS. The correspondences between the packages
may be summarized as:

* **main ~ main**: The vrs-python main branch tracks the vrs main branch.
* **develop ~ develop**: The vrs-python develop branch tracks the vrs develop branch.
* **0.6 ~ 1.1**: vrs-python 0.6 branch tracks the vrs 1.1 branch.
* **0.7 ~ 1.2**: vrs-python 0.7 branch tracks the vrs 1.2 branch.

âš  **Developers: See the development section below for recommendations
for using submodules gracefully (and without causing problems for others!).**


# Installation

## Installing with pip

    $ pip install ga4gh.vrs[extras]

The `[extras]` argument tells pip to install packages to fullfill the
dependencies of the `ga4gh.vrs.extras` package.


## Installing dependencies for ga4gh.vrs.extras

The `ga4gh.vrs.extras` modules are not part of the VR spec per se.
They are bundled with ga4gh.vrs for development and installation
convenience.  These modules depend directly and indrectly on external
data sources of sequences, transcripts, and genome-transcript
alignments.  This section recommends one way to install the biocommons
tools that provide these data.

    $ docker volume create --name=uta_vol
    $ docker volume create --name=seqrepo_vol
    $ docker-compose up

This should start three containers, one of which exits after loading (~5 minutes):

  * [seqrepo](https://github.com/biocommons/seqrepo): downloads seqrepo into a docker volume and exits
  * [seqrepo-rest-service](https://github.com/biocommons/seqrepo-rest-service): a REST service on seqrepo (localhost:5000)
  * [uta](https://github.com/biocommons/uta): a database of transcripts and alignments (localhost:5432)


    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                    //  NAMES
    86e872ab0c69        biocommons/seqrepo-rest-service:latest   //  vrs-python_seqrepo-rest-service_1
    a40576b8cf1f        biocommons/uta:uta_20180821              //  vrs-python_uta_1


You can test UTA and seqrepo installations like so:

    snafu$ psql -XAt postgres://anonymous@localhost/uta -c 'select count(*) from transcript'
    249909


# Running the Notebooks

Once installed as described above, type

    $ source venv/3.7/bin/activate
    $ jupyter notebook --notebook-dir notebooks/


The following jupyter extensions are recommended but not required

    $ pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
    $ jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
    $ jupyter nbextension enable toc2/main
  

# Development

## Submodules!

vrs-python embeds vrs as a submodule.  When checking out vrs-python
and switching branches, it is important to make sure that the
submodule tracks vrs-python correctly.  The recommended way to do this
is `git config --global submodule.recurse true`.

Alternatively, see `misc/githooks/`. 


## Installing for development

Fork the repo at https://github.com/ga4gh/vrs-python/ .


    $ git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_ID/vrs-python.git
    $ cd vrs-python
    $ make devready


## Testing

This package implements typical unit tests for ga4gh.core and
ga4gh.vrs.  This package also implements the compliance tests from vrs
(vrs/validation) in the tests/validation/ directory.

    $ make test


## Developing VRS (the schema) too

If you want to develop the VRS schema in conjunction with vrs-python,
the recommended approach for most users is to fork and clone the
`ga4gh/vrs` repo, then set the `VRS_SCHEMA_DIR` environment variable
to use an alternative schema location.


# Security Note (from the GA4GH Security Team)

A stand-alone security review has been performed on the specification
itself.  This implementation is offered as-is, and without any
security guarantees. It will need an independent security review
before it can be considered ready for use in security-critical
applications. If you integrate this code into your application it is
AT YOUR OWN RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY to arrange for a security audit.
